# Getting started with Python
This chapter will cover what Python is and how to get Python setup on your computer.

## What is Python?
Python is a programming language. There are many programming languages like C, C++, C#, Julia, Javascript, R, etc. There are so many languages because many languages were developed for specific purposes. R is a statistical language, C is a low-level, and Python is general purpose language. Programming languages have different features. Languages can be interpreted or compiled, and statically or dynamically typed. Python is an interpreted language and dynamically typed. An interpreted language mean that there is another program that executes the program that you write. To run an interpreted language you need to install the interpreter. Dynamically vs statically typed is something that we will cover in a later chapter.

## Setting up your Python environment
There are several ways you can get started using Python. I will cover the different tools you can use to run Python. First we will cover local tools or tools you can run directly on your computer. I will also cover how to setup Python on Windows, Mac and Linux since there are differences between each. Then I will cover remote tools where you can run your data on an external resource.

### Local Python
When running Python locally, whatever tool you use you will have to become familiar with using the command-line/terminal.

#### Anaconda
The easiest way for many people getting started with Python is to use Anaconda. Anaconda is a prepackaged Python version manager. It comes preinstalled with most of the commonly used scientific Python packages.
