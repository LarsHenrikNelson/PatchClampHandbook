# Patch Clamp Handbook

by Lars H. Nelson

Patch Clamp Handbook is an introduction to the design of common electrophysiology experiments and analysis of the resulting data.

For each chapter there is a jupyter notebook and associated data. You can download the chapters as PDFs or Jupyter notebooks directly from each chapter or you can go to https://github.com/LarsHenrikNelson/PatchClampHandbook. The book is split into two sections. The first section is the electrophysiology and tutorials. The second section gets more into how to setup and use Python. The electropysiology section does not require knowledge of Python per se but is uses Python to analyze the data.
