# Patch Clamp Handbook

### This book still currently in the process of being written

Patch Clamp Handbook is an introduction to the design of common electrophysiology experiments and analysis of the resulting data. Additionally, I cover some things that many other electrophysiolog tutorials do not. Parts of the book are not complete.

For each chapter there is a jupyter notebook and associated data. You can download the chapters as PDFs or Jupyter notebooks directly from each chapter or you can go to https://github.com/LarsHenrikNelson/PatchClampHandbook. If you have never used Python before I suggest starting with the appendix.
