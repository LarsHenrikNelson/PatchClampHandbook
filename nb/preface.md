# Preface

I wrote this book for several reasons. I have written several electrophysiology data processing packages in Python and felt like there was no one good source for learning about electrophysiology, signal processing, and data analysis. Electrophysiology also has the problem of the Beginners Curse. There is a pretty steep learning curve for both being able to do experiments and analyze experiments. The steeper the learning curve the worse your outcomes at the beginning (thus the curse). To help people get over that hill faster I thought I would write a modern, electrophysiology handbook. In my personal journey I had a lot of web searchs (or more recently LLM queries) and a lot time wasted on bad resources (including many LLM queries) or pulling snippets from different sources. Along the way of learning how to process and analyze electrophysiology data I also learned a lot about why you would want to do certain experiments. I thought why not combine electrophysiology analysis with the reasons why we do certain experiments. Lastly, to push the envelope of your experimental design I believe that you must embrace custom analysis. Your experiments are only as good as your analysis. With the NIH looking to push computational modeling it is even more important to really understand the data you collect.

This book is divided into two parts. The first parts covers essential slice electrophyiosology topics and how to use Python to analyze results from experiments. The first part of the covers analysis of expirements. I cover both how to process the raw data and tools available in Python. I also cover some statistical topics that I feel really needs more attention by both neuroscientists and electrophysiologists.
I would like to thank the many useful people (AKA lab mice and guinea pigs) who have given me feedback.
