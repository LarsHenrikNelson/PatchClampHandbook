# Preface

I wrote this book for several reasons. I have written several electrophysiology data processing packages in Python and felt like there was no one good source for learning about electrophysiology signal processing and data analysis. This led to a lot of web searchs (or more recently LLM queries) and a lot time wasted on bad resources (including LLM queries) or pulling snippets from different sources. Along the way of learing how to process and analyze electrophysiology data I also learned a lot about why you would want to do certain experiments. I thought why not combine electrophysiology analysis with the reasons why we do certain experiments. Lastly, to push the envelope of your experimental design I believe that you must embrace custom analysis.

This book is divided into two parts. The first parts covers essential slice electrophyiosology topics and how to use Python to analyze results from experiments. The second part of the book covers the basics of Python. If you have not used Python read the second part of the book first. This book is not intended to replace other books and tutorials on how to use Python.

I would like to thank the many useful people (AKA lab mice and guinea pigs) who have given me feedback.
