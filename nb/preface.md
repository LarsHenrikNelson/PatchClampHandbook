# Preface

I wrote this book for several reasons. I have written several electrophysiology data processing packages in python and felt like there was no one good source for learning about electrophysiology processing. This lead to a lot of web search (or more recently LLM queries) and a lot time wasted on bad resources or pulling snippets from different sources. Along the way of learing how to process and analyze electrophysiology data I also learn a lot about why you would want to do certain experiments. I thought why not combine electrophysiology analysis with the reasons why we collect the data.

I would like to thank the many useful people (AKA lab mice and guinea pigs) who have given me feedback.
