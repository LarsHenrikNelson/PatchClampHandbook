# Current clamp
Current clamp recordings are one of the most common patch-clamp experiment. Current clamp experiments allow you to get the active parameters of cells. Namely gain, rheobase and spike threshold. Current clamp recordings typically use stepped currrent injections or ramps and you are investigating the voltage change due to the current injection and whether and how the cell spikes. The current clamp chapter is divide into two parts. The first part is a basic analysis and covers what features we look for and why they are important. The second part will delve much deeper in relationships between spike features and cover differences between a few cell types; pyramidal cells, spiny projection neurons and parvalbumin interneurons.

## Experimental considerations for current clamp recordings
### Internal and external solutions
You will need to a standard ACSF for recording. Many labs mantain the ACSF at physiological temperatures which is considered ~32&deg;C however you can record at room temperature but, reviewers may not like it. I recommend recording at 32&deg;C. You can include drugs in the bath to block synaptic activity but do not need to include these. If you are having a lot of recurrent input that is driving spikes, depolarizations or hyperpolarizations in your cells if may be good to include some drugs to block synpatic currents. The one problem with blocking synaptic currents there can be homestatic changes in cell functin due to changes in or lack of synaptic input. These are considerations you need to consider. I would recommend starting without any drugs in the bath to keep it simple.

### To use a holding current or not
One thing to consider is whether you should inject a holding current to bring the cell to a specific resting potential value. Many studies inject some current to hold the cell at around -70mV or the cell types preferred membrane voltage and run their current pulses or ramps based on that holding current. There are a few studies that do not inject any holding current and even argue against injecting any holding current. The question is whether rheobase is the current it takes to get a cell to spike from a specific membrane voltage or from where the resting membrane potential is? In the case of dopaminergic cells, VTA interneurons or SST cells, these cells are usually spiking spontaneously and to test rheobase you have to inject some current so you will likely need to at least hold them below the spike threshold. Both methods have their merits.

### Steps vs ramps
As mentioned in the beginning, you can record stepped currents or ramps. Stepped currents are the most common. Usually there are negative and positive steps. The negative steps can go as low as -150 to -200 pA and positive currents can as high as 600 pA (some interneurons have a very high rheobase), Steps can be irregular or regularly spaced. One problem with ramps is that some cells have depolarization block and may not spike during a ramp but will during a set of stepped pulses. Depolarization block is the inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels due to long membrane depolarizations that does not elicit any spikes. There are conditions, such as epilepsy, where depolarization block may actually be a feature of the altered cell physiology and you could use the ramp to test whether this occurs. Below you can see and example current injection cycle and a ramp.
