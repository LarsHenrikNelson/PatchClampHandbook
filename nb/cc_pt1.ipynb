    "## Measuring delta V and getting the IV curve\n",
    "The first concept we are going to cover is delta V and analyzing the IV (current-voltage curve). Delta V is simply the change in voltage due to the current injection. The IV curve is used to calculate the membrane resistance. Remember that voltage difference = current * resistance ($\\Delta V=IR$). This can be calculated by finding the baseline voltage of the acquisition and subtracting voltage during the pulse. There are some things consider when calculating the voltage during the current injection. There can be changes in voltage due channels that open such as due to HCN channels that cause a sag in the voltage. To get the delta V you can take the mean of just a portion of the current injection. For cells that have a voltage sag, you may actually want to get the mean of the portion around the peak sag. You could also get the delta V by taking the mean after the sag since for cells without $Ih$ currents this will be the steady state of the cell unaffected by capacitance. Other cells show a charging with positive current where the membrane voltage increases linearly over the current injection. I have seen this in dopaminergic cells and MSNs. There are two ways that I would structure the analysis. One is to find the minimum and take the mean of the values around the minimum. The other is to just take the mean over a portion of the current injection. No matter what, you will want to avoid the very beginning of the acquisition since the is membrane is charging due to capacitance. You could also structure your analysis to you use different methods for negative pulses and positive pulses. You could even get $\\Delta V$ by curve fitting and using the amplitude of the fit as $\\Delta V$, however this is risky if your curve does not fit well."

    "Next we will need to measure the delta V for all pulses except those with spikes. The reason that we do not measure the delta V for acquisitions with spikes is that spiking activity is a seperate state compared to non-spiking. So we will simply exclude acquisitions with spikes. We will do this by ignoring acquisitions with voltages greater than -20 mV. We will also need the pulse amplitude of each acquisition which is located in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice there is a linear relationship between current and voltage. To get the membrane resistance from these data we just have to run a linear regression between the current and delta V. There are a couple ways that you can run the linear regression. One is you can take all delta Vs, you can take just a subset or you can rectify or take the absolute value of the delta Vs before running the regression. We will do all three since it is easy to do in Python. One really important thing to note is the units of the regressors. current is in pA and delta V is in mV and we need to get to MOhms. To do this we multiply the slope by 1000 to get MOhm. If you run the code below you see that the answers are fairly close. One reason to choose the subset version is that you may change the membrane resistance as the cell gets close to spiking even if it does not spike. However, I have seen all three measures used and many papers never disclose what the current injection range was used for calculating the membrane resistance."

    "## Ih voltage sag\n",
    "Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated (HCN) channels are typically responsible for the voltage sag in a current clamp acquisitions. Voltage sag is when the voltage drop is initially larger at the beginning of the current injection than at the end. Many cell types have Ih voltage sag such as dopaminergic cells and layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Measuring voltage sag is fairly straightforward. You just measure the voltage difference between the peak sag and and the voltage in the second half of the current injection similar to measuring delta V. The main way I have seen voltage sag reported is by measuring the sag on the most negative current injection. You could also technically run an IV curve for the voltage sag. To truly determine whether the voltage sag is due to HCN channels you would need to do a flow-in experiment with the drug ZD7288. If you want to run the IV curve I challenge you to modify the IV code above to get the resistance of the channels contributing to the voltage sag."

When resistence increases, the current need to achieve the same delta V decreases. This means that a cell will higher membrane resistance will likely need less synaptic to be able to spike. There are a couple ways you can find rheobase. Find the minimum current needed to get the cell to spike out of all 4 cycles. I do not recommend this since there is variability between cycles and the variability could be affected by a treatment or other factors. Find the minimum current needed to get the cell to spike for each cycle and average the result. This is the method I recommend. The way I find rheobase below depends on the acquisitions being assigned to a cycle (1 to inf) which ClampSuite automatically. This may not be the case for your data.

    "First let's look at the FI data that we extracted from the acquisitions. We are going to curve fit the FI curve. We will use Scipy's [curve_fit](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html). This function needs a function passed to it, in this case it is the sigmoid function as well as an array for the x values and y values. There are many other factors that you could pass, such as bounding factors but are not needed in this case. Lastly you can fit the entire array of current values, however neurons will only spike when there is a net positive current injection. We can truncate our arrays of current and hertz so that only the pairs that have a current >= 0 are kept. You can fit the sigmoid curve to whole set of data and it will likely fit well."

    "## Spike threshold\n",
    "Spike threshold is tells you at what voltage a cells spike is elicited. This different from rheobase. Spike threhold is primarly set by the number of sodium channels on the axon hillock. The spike threshold is important because it is a bifurcation point in the function of a neuron. If you want to read more about this I suggest reading \"Dynamical systems in neuroscience: the geometry of excitability and bursting\" [@izhikevich_dynamical_2007]. A lower spike threshold can show up as a lower rheobase in neurons whose voltage continues to rise during the current injection before a spike occurs. I have seen this occur in cortical pyramidal neurons and spiny projection neurons but not parvalbumin inhibitory neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can measure spike threshold on any acquisition that has a spike, however usually just the spikes from the rheobase acquisitions are used to calculate the spike threshold. There are several ways to calculate the spike threshold such a the first derivative, second derivative, third derivative, and a max curvature [@sekerli_estimating_2004]. I find the third derivative and method VII to be the most consistent. We will use the third derivative method in this tutorial. The way I typically differentiate signals is by using Numpy's [gradient](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.gradient.html). Unlike [diff](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.diff.html), [gradient](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.gradient.html) returns an array of the same length as the input signal which makes downstream analysis easier. It has the downside in that if you have small peaks you will get some artifacts in the signal which upsampling can counteract. One problem I found with the third derivative is that the peaks found a usually to late by 1 sample at 10000 Hz so I adjust the spike threshold backwards by 1 sample. I also z-score the derivative since this keeps the peak finding threshold consistent between acquisitions."

One thing we are going to do just for visualization purposes is limit the extent of the x-axis so that we are just looking at the first spike and for a point of reference we are going to use the spike peak. If you look at the third derivative we want to extract the first positive peak. There are some additions that I have found are helpful."

    "## Spike half-width and width\n",
    "The next waveform feature that we can measure is the spike (half) width. Half width is important because it can help you determine if there is broadening or shortening of the waveform. Broadening of the waveform can be due to inactivation of the voltage-gated potassium channels, slower-inactivating sodium channels or even decreased activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. Wavefrom broadening increases synaptic output by increasing release probability by increasing the time calcium is in the presynapse [@zbili_past_2019]. This is where the voltage crosses half way between the spike threshold and peak. One important caveat of measuring spike width as the half-way point is that if your spike threshold or peak is changed then your half-width will likely be different.\n",

    "The spike afterhyperpolarization (AHP) is the refactory period, the period where a neuron cannot fire another action potential. The AHP is defined as when the membrane voltage drops below the resting membrane potential of a neuron. However, when injecting current in slices or cell culture, you will rarely see the AHP drop below the resting membrane potential or the potential where the cell is being held instead I have seen the AHP defined as when the spike drops below the spike threshold. The are a a couple ways that you could analyze the AHP. One way is setting a cutoff after the spike for what part of the AHP you want to analyze and integrate over that period. One thing to consider with this method is that you will likely want to integrate over a percent of the AHP rather than using a strict time cutoff since the AHP will get shorter at higher spike frequencies. This is typically how people calculate the slow and fast components of the AHP. You can also find the peak or most negative component of the AHP and when it occurs. For our analysis we will analyze the voltage of the peak (most negative) AHP."

    "## Spike derivative\n",
    "The spike derivative is useful because we can look at the currents underlying the spike itself. While we cannot see the exact Na+, K+ and Ca+ currents we can get an idea of what currents might be altered. To convert a voltage spike to current spike we must multiply the spike derivative by the capacitance of the cell since the current (I) = -C*dV/dt. The current action potential is very similar to the current action potentials that you get when you record spontaneous action potentials is cell-attached voltage-clamp mode. This equation works because a cell is a capacitor due to the lipid membrane. The first peak, or most negative peak primarily consists of Na+ currents where as the second peak likely consists of K+ and Ca+ currents [@bean_action_2007]. One interesting thing to note is the peak current in these spikes (~-2000 pA) is typically around the current you get with unclamped spikes when running a electrical/optical stimulation experiment."

    "## Membrane time constant\n",
    "The membrane time constant is the decay tau of a the exponential decay that the membrane undergoes during negative pulse injects. It gives you an idea of how membrane capacitance and resistance interact. The membrane time constant equation is: $\\tau=rc$. We have to remember that the membrane is a resistor and capacitor in parallel which means when we inject a current it will take time for the membrane to reach a steady state voltage. One factor to consider when measuring the membrane time constant is that you have to choose how to define the amplitude. Do you choose the minimum voltage which could be influenced by HCN channels causing voltage sag or do you choose the delta V that we measured earlier?  There are two way you can find the time constant. The first is you can find the time is takes for for the voltage go below 1/3 of the delta V amplitude. Or you can think if you baseline starts at some value and you end at 0, the membrane time constant is how long it takes to get to 1/3 the initial value. Alternatively you can curve fit the voltage trace to an exponential decay. We will not curve fit here because I have found it to be very tricky to curve fit, especially when you have *Ih* currents. Some neurons have voltage sag which means those neurons do not act as a pure RC circuits. Some neurons have a very square shaped voltage response (very little capacitance) which really throws off the curve fit. You can reduce the effects of HCN channels by using the negative (or positive) acquisitions that are close to 0 current injection."
