Functions are created using the syntax `def function_name(args...):`. Everything inside a function needs to be 4 whites spaces in. Most code editors allow you to use tab and insert the spaces for you. You can have positional, keyword, *args and **kwargs. Positional keywords mean you can just pass a value to a function without specifying which argument it is, the input will automatically be assigned to the arguments in order they occur in the function definition. Keywords can be supplied in any order but you must specify which argument they go to. Default (or optional) arguments are defined in the function definition (such b and c) where as a is necessary. *args are positional arguments not specified in the function definition but can be accessed in the fuction as a tuple. **kwargs are keyword arguments that are not specified in the function definition but can be accessed in the function as a dictionary. *args and **kwargs can be confusing, if anything I recommend sticking with **kwargs in the beginning. You will notice below that you can return all the items from a function into a single variable or explode the list into three variables. You can pass anything to a function in Python including other functions such as the built-in `list()`."
