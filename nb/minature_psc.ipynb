    "# Miniature/spotaneous postsynaptic currents\n",
    "Analyzing miniature/spontaneous postsynaptic currents (m/sPSCs) is one of the most common analyses in patch clamp electrophysiology. m/sPSCs are ionic currents from AMPA, NMDA, glycine, or GABAA receptors that are evoked due to release of a single or multiple synaptic vesicles. We will cover both mPSCs and sPSCs, and go over how to find and analyze PSC events. While this chapter is PSCs, most of the theory applies to miniature/spontaneous postsynaptic potentials (PSPs). There are several experiments you can do; synapse number, silent synapses, excitatory/inhibitory ratio, synaptic multiplicity, and changes in synaptic release regulated by other non-ionic receptors."

    "## Miniature postsynaptic currents\n",
    "Miniature postsynaptic currents (mPSCs) are ionic currents evoked from the release of a single synaptic vesicle {cite}`del_castillo_quantal_1954`. Frequency of mPSCs is used as a proxy for the number of functional synapses (synapses that have presynaptic input) that contain the receptor of interest (but not necessarily the number of synapses). The interpretation of mPSC data depends on what receptor you are recording from. If you are recording mEPSCs from AMPARs then you are likely getting the number of \"active\" or \"non-silent\" synapses. If you are recording NMDARs could be looking at the number of silent synapses (only if you compare to the AMPAR mEPSCs). If you are recording mIPSCs then you are getting the number of inhibitory synapses. With mIPSCs you could be getting GABAAR or GlyR. One important caveat of mPSCs is that you are not getting where the presynaptic input is coming from. If you want projection specific synaptic input you need to run a different type of experiment than we will be covering here, but is covered later in the book.\n",

    "There are several important features of mPSCs that you will want to analyze. The primary feature is mPSC frequency (the number of events occuring every second). Frequency is used as a proxy for the number of synapses that contain the receptor whose currents you are recording. The more mPSCs, the more synapses. However, if there are changes in release probability you could also get a change in frequency without a change in synapse number. To determine whether there are changes in release probability you will need to run some pair-pulse experiments which are described in a later chapter. Another feature is mPSC amplitude. A larger amplitude could mean two things. Larger mPSCs could mean there are more receptors at the postsynaptic element. Alternatively, larger mPSCs could mean that you get less distal synapses due to decreased dendritic length or more synapses close to the cell body (probably less likely to occur). Amplitude of mPSCs decreases the further from the cell body that the event occurs due to dendritic filtering. To rule out one of the interpretations you can use the mEPSC rise rate (amplitude/peak_time-baseline_start). More distal mPSCs should have a slower rise rate. Lastly, you can look at the tau or decay rate of the mPSC. Changes in tau are usually due to changes in receptor subunit composition. Tau is especially useful when you need to identify specific cells types. Interneurons, like parvalbumin interneurons, have a very short mPESC tau compared to pyramidal neurons. Tau can also be affected by dendritic filtering."
