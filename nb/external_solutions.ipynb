    "# External solutions\n",
    "External solutions are very important for getting good recordings. External solutions for slice electrophysoilogy are generally referred to as artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF). There are many variaties of ACSF. Some recordings cannot be done without specific types of ACSF. Some protocols use different ACSF for cutting, incubation and recording while other protocols use one solution for everything. ACSF was designed to be a physiological buffer that matches external ionic balance, osmolarity and pH that neurons experience *in-vivo*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A bicarbonate-based buffer\n",
    "A majority of ACSF recipes are bicarbonate-buffer based solutions that need CO2 to maintain a pH of around 7.4. Bicarbonate is actually a terrible pH buffer because it is very volatile, especially compared to other to pH buffers like HEPES and degrades quickly in the presence of H+. However, bicarbonate is a very physiological buffer in that it is the main way the O2/CO2 balance is managed in our bodies. While bicarbonate is volatile, our bodies are constantly producing bicarbonate but this is not so in solution so the levels of bicarbonate are carefully chosen to ensure that the pH remains close to 7.4 while bubbling with carbogen without having to add an acid or base. There is a little bit of sodium phosphate buffer in ACSF, bicarbonate is by far the biggest contributor to pH buffering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Osmolarity\n",
    "Osmolality of ACSF is generally anywhere from 280-310 with the vast majority of papers reporting osmolality between 295-305. The ACSF osmolarity should be balanced with your internal osmolarity. It is general recommended that the difference in osmolarity between the ACSF be between -5 (higher osmolarity in the internal) to 10. In my hands, an osmolarity difference greater than 10 almost always causes problems with the access resistance where the access resistance is either high or rapidly climbs over the recording. There are two ways I have heard of to adjust the osmolarity of the the ACSF. One is to just add or remove water (this seems controversial). Adding/removing water will change your overall ionic concentrations. The other way is to add or remove glucose. For smaller changes you could potentially adjust the amount of NaCl/choline/sucrose/NMDG in the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common reagents\n",
    "- **Na+**: Neurons need a lot of Na+ to spike since there are large amounts of Na+ channnels in neurons. You also have to have Na+ to get AMPA currents.\n",
    "- **Bicarbonate**: Used as a pH buffer when the ACSF solution is bubbled with carbogen (95%O2/5%CO2). Your body has an endogenous [bicarbonate buffer system](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicarbonate_buffer_system) so the bicarbonate is also an attempt to replicate this system. Bicarbonate is also used to prevent cell swelling however I have also been told that higher concentrations can make the membrane \"stiffer\". Bicarbonate is provided as sodium bicarbonate or choline bicarbonate. If your experiments include manipulating the cholinergic system you probably want to use sodium bicarbonate.\n",
    "- **Sodium phosphate (monobasic monohydrate)**: Helps maintain pH and phosphate can technically be used for energy generation (the ATP).\n",
    "- **K+**: Neurons need K+ for spiking in particular the afterhyperpolarization potential and maintaining the ionic balance. I have found that if you forget to K+ to the ACSF all the cells in the slice disapeer. Typically added as KCl.\n",
    "- **Mg**: Mg+ blocks NMDARs. High levels inhibit activity and low or absent levels can induce spontaneous activity in slices. Mg+ is usually used in two different forms: MgCl2 6*H2O or MgSO4 7*H2O. The choice probably depends on how much Cl- **you are adding with other reagents (NaCl, CaCl2, KCl, etc).\n",
    "- **Ca++**: Ca++ is need for Ca++ gated voltage channels as well as NMDAR currents. There are even some configurations of AMPARs that are permeable to Ca++. Ca++ is typically added using CaCl2 2*H2O.\n",
    "- **HEPES**: HEPES is used to prevent edema in tissue slices [@macgregor_hepes_2001]. HEPES is also a pH buffer that is resistant to changes in carbon dioxide levels.\n",
    "- **Choline**: Methylated organic cation that replaces Na+ to prevent excitotoxicity (rapid influx of Na+) while maintaining the nature ionic gradient.\n",
    "- **NMDG**: Methylated organic cation that replaces Na+ to prevent excitotoxicity (rapid influx of Na+) while maintaining the nature ionic gradient.\n",
    "- **Glucose**: Provides an energy source to the cells and is used to adjust the osmolarity.\n",
    "- **Sucrose**: Used increase the osmolarity of a solution and also to replace Na+ when trying to prevent excitotoxicity. One interesting thing about sucrose it that because it has more -OH groups than glucose it is more likely to draw water with it than glucose[@ebrahimi_osmotic_2016]. So if you want to prevent water from going into the cell membrane then adding sucrose to the extracellular solution could help which is probably why it was orginally used in cutting solutions.\n",
    "- **Pyruvate**: Energy source used in the citric acid cycle. Can also be used as an antioxidant. This helps keep cells healthy.\n",
    "- **Ascorbate**: Also known as vitamin C or citric acid, can be used as an antioxidant and is involved in the citric acid cycle. This helps keep cells healthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some basic tips for making external solutions:\n",
    "- Do not make stock solutions with sodium/choline bicarbonate. In the absence of CO2, bicarbonate quickly makes the solution alkaline. Once the solution is alkaline you can bubble with carbogen but it can take a while, if ever, for the solution to return to 7.4 pH. If you add an acid like HCl the bicarbonate turns in to NaCl, H2O and CO2 so avoid adding HCl to titrate the pH.\n",
    "- <font color=\"magenta\">**Important**</font>: Bubble the ACSF with carbogen before adding MgSO4, MgCl2 or CaCl2 as these can precipitate out when the pH is above ~7.6. \n",
    "- <font color=\"orange\">**Suggested**</font>: Bubble CaCl2 with carbogen before adding to the ACSF. \n",
    "- Use volumetric flasks if possible.\n",
    "- Always start with less water than you need, add the reagents and then top off the solution with water to the volume you need. \n",
    "- Always use high purity water, typically water made by a MilliQ machine or water that had ~18.2 MOhm of resistance (this is highly pure water).\n",
    "- Magnesium comes in a SO4 or a Cl2 form. Both forms are hydrated which means that the molecular weight include water. You will need to caculate the pure molecular weight of MgSO4 or MgCl2 to calculate the concentration and adjust the amount of reagent used to account for the hydration of the magnesium reagent.\n",
    "- It is important to note that the NaCl and glucose/dextrose concentrations can be adjusted and are often different from lab to lab. These differences may be due to the osmolarity and ionic balance of the internal used."

    "### Standard/Recording ACSF\n",
    "Standard ACSF is the primary solution for electrophysiology recording.  It generally contains Na+, K+, Ca++, Mg++, sodium phosphate (typically monosodium monophosphate monohydrate), sodium bicarbonate and glucose. Most recording ACSF recipes I have seen have higher Ca++ than Mg++. The Ca++ and Mg++ concentrations will vary between labs. Additionally if you lower both Ca++ and Mg++ to 1.0 and 0.25 mOsmo respectively (which is sometimes called Ringer's Solution) you can induce spontaneous activity in pyramidal cells. Recipes are handed down from lab personnel to lab personnel so the original considerations for using the recipe are typically lost to time. Below is a protocol that you can use. For the KCl, MgCl2, and CaCl2 you can make 10x stock solutions.  \n",

Choline ACSF can be used as a perfusion, cutting and short duration (~10 min) recovery solution.

Choline ACSF also contains thiourea (occasionally), Na-pyruvate and Na-ascorbate. Choline ACSF can be chilled before use or even frozen to a slush. However, we have found that slushy choline ACSF during the slicing step is bad for adult tissue. We advise using either room temperature or chilled choline ACSF. Choline is a mild agonist at acetylcholine receptors so if you are studying the cholinergic system do not use choline ACSF. When choline ACFS is used as a recovery solution do not leave the slices in choline ACSF for more than 10-15 min. In my hands prolonged incubation in choline ACSF increases access resistance to the point where it is impossible to get usable cells.\n",

    "### HEPES Holding ACSF \n",
    "HEPES holding ACSF is like standard ACSF except that it has lower Na+ and has HEPES added to prevent edema. Edema primarily occurs in adult brain slices, the older the mouse/rat the tissue came from the worse the edema. There are some labs that use the HEPES holding ACSF no matter what. I am not sure it makes a difference for most recordings but that could depend on the cell type, brain region and type of tissue. HEPES ACSF also contains thiourea, Na-pyruvate and Na-ascorbate similar to what you would find in the choline and NMDG ACSF. \n",

    "Magnesium-free ACSF is ACSF with very little or no magnesium added. Some recipes increase Ca++ to make up for the osmolarity and ionic gradient difference. The only time I have seen this used is if you want to record NMDAR currents at -70 mV or if you want to induce epileptic-like activity in the cortex. As mentioned above there is a Ringer's solution that still contains Mg++ that might be better for moderate amounts of spontaneous activity if you want to avoid epileptic-like activity. You will need to add TTX to the ACSF to prevent seizure-like activity if you are recording without any Mg++."

    "Strontium ACSF has the calcium replaced with Sr2+. Generally, strontium ACSF recording projection/cell-type specific quantal events. Sr2+ is less effectively bound by proteins that are involved in synaptic vesicle release. As such when doing electrical or optogenetic stimulation you can get a large peak followed by small quantal events that occur during the decay of the event. It is not recommended to use this ACSF for holding tissue for long periods of time. See the optogenetic stimulation section for more about this experiment. \n",

    "DMSO is usually needed for nonpolar drugs that you want to bath apply to your slices. I have seen it used at a concentrate of 1 uM in the ACSF. I would not recommend including this in your holding solutions and only using it in your recording solution if you need it. I have heard that it can make is harder to patch cells so some labs will first patch a cell in regular ACSF, then add DMSO and do their baseline recordings, and finally wash in their drug. Since you will need to flush the rig between bath applications of your drug it is pretty easy to just add some DMSO to your recording ACSF when needed. Also, I have seen that DMSO may built up in the tubing and in the incubation well. The DMSO/drug residue can be cleaned by just flushing the rig with 70% EtOH."
