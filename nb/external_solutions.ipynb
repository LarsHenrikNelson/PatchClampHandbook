    "# External solutions\n",
    "External solutions are very important for getting good recordings. External solutions are generally referred to as artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF). Some recordings cannot be done without specific types of external solutions. Some protocols use different external solutions for cutting, incubation and recording while other protocols use one solution for everything. Some solutions need to be pH balanced by bubbling with carbogen gas (95% O2/5% CO2) and other solutions may not. Carbogen is also used to oxygenate tissue or cells in solution. If maintaining pH is not an issue, then O2 can be blown across the bath however, this is uncommon for standard slice electrophysiology. Osmolality of solutions is generally anywhere from 280-310 with the vast majority of papers reporting osmolality between 295-305. The ACSF osmolarity should be balanced with your internal osmolarity. It is general recommended that the difference in osmolarity between the ACSF be between -5 (higher osmolarity in the internal) to 10. In my hands, an osmolarity difference greater than 10 almost always causes problems with the access resistance where the access resistance is either high or rapidly climbs over the recording. There are two ways I have heard of to adjust the osmolarity of the the ACSF. One is to just add or remove water (this seems controversial). Adding/removing water will change your overall ionic concentrations. The other way is to add or remove glucose. For smaller changes you could potentially adjust the amount of NaCl/choline/sucrose/NMDG in the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three stages of preparing and recording from brain slices for electrophysiology where different types of ACSF may be used: Cutting, recovery and recording. For cutting and/or recovery solutions labs often replace sodium chloride with NMDG, choline or sucrose. This is to prevent excess cell death due to rapid influx of NA+ and excitotoxic cell death or cell swelling then shrinkage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some basic tips for making external solutions:\n",
    "- <font color=\"magenta\">**Important**</font>: Bubble the ACSF with carbogen before adding MgSO4, MgCl2 or CaCl2 as these can precipitate out. \n",
    "- <font color=\"magenta\">**Important**</font>: Bubble CaCl2 with carbogen before adding to the ACSF. \n",
    "- Use volumetric flasks if possible.\n",
    "- Always start with less water than you need, add the reagents and then top off the solution with water to the volume you need. \n",
    "- Always use high purity water, typically water made by a MilliQ machine or water that had ~18.2 MOhm of resistance (this is highly pure water).\n",
    "- Make stock solutions as these will save you time.\n",
    "- Magnesium comes in a SO4 or a Cl2 form. Both forms are hydrated which means that the molecular weight include water. You will need to caculate the pure molecular weight of MgSO4 or MgCl2 to calculate the concentration and adjust the amount of reagent used to account for the hydration of the magnesium reagent.\n",
    "- It is important to note that the NaCl and glucose/dextrose concentrations can be adjusted and are often different from lab to lab. These differences may be due to the osmolarity of the internal used"

    "### Standard/Recording ACSF\n",
    "Standard ACSF is the primary solution for electrophysiology recording.  It generally contains Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, sodium phosphate (typically monosodium monophosphate monohydrate), sodium bicarbonate and glucose. Most recording ACSF recipes I have seen have higher Ca2+ than Mg2+. The Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations will vary between labs. Additionally if you lower both Ca2+ and Mg2+ to 1.0 and 0.25 mOsmo respectively (which is sometimes called Ringer's Solution) you can induce spontaneous activity in pyramidal cells. Recipes are handed down from lab personnel to lab personnel so the original considerations for using the recipe are typically lost to time. Below is a protocol that you can use. For the KCl, MgCl2, and CaCl2 you can make 10x stock solutions.  \n",

    "### Choline ACSF \n",
    "Choline ACSF is like standard ACSF except that choline chloride is used instead of sodium chloride. Choline chloride is a methylated organic cation that leads to decreased sodium channel permeability. Choline ACSF can be used as a perfusion, cutting and short duration (~10 min) recovery solution. When used as a cutting solution it is generally chilled and when used as a recovery solution it is generally heated to ~32 C. Choline ACSF also contains thiourea (occasionally), Na-pyruvate and Na-ascorbate. Choline ACSF can be chilled before use or even frozen to a slush. However, we have found that slushy choline ACSF during the slicing step is bad for adult tissue. We advise using either room temperature or chilled choline ACSF. Choline is a mild agonist at acetylcholine receptors so if you are studying the cholinergic system do not use choline ACSF. When choline ACFS is used as a recovery solution do not leave the slices in choline ACSF for more than 10-15 min. In my hands prolonged incubation in choline ACSF increases access resistance to the point where it is impossible to get usable cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recipe notes:\n",
    "- The first 3 ingredients can be made as a 10x stock solution.\n",
    "- Choline is solid as a dehydrated powder and hydrates fairly quickly. It should be stored in a desiccant box or under vacuum. When choline hydrates it seems to go bad quickly. Choline hydration can change how much choline you are adding since there is water mixed in with the choline."

When used as a cutting solution it is generally chilled and when used as a recovery solution it is generally heated to ~32 C. NMDG ACSF also contains thiourea, Na-pyruvate and Na-ascorbate. NMDG ACSF can be chilled or used at room temperature for the slicing step. Freezing the NMDG to the point of being slushy is not recommended. Compared to sucrose based ACSF, NMDG is more effective at preventing cell swelling immediately after cutting and cell shrinkage in the long term. There are no studies comparing choline and NMDG. Do not leave your slices in the NMDG recovery solution for more than 12 min {cite}`martina_patch-clamp_2014`. NMDG recovery seems to promote good neuronal morphology at the expense of good neuronal function (i.e. your good neurons are easier to see but so are the bad neurons even if they don't look bad).\n",

Edema primarily occurs in adult brain slices, the older the mouse/rat the tissue came from the worse the edema. There are some labs that use the HEPES holding ACSF no matter what. I am not sure it makes a difference for most recordings but that could depend on the cell type, brain region and type of tissue.

The only time I have seen this used is if you want to record NMDAR currents at -70 mV or if you want to induce epileptic-like activity in the cortex. As mentioned above there is a Ringer's solution that still contains Mg2+ that might be better for moderate amounts of spontaneous activity if you want to avoid epileptic-like activity. You will need to add TTX to the ACSF to prevent seizure-like activity if you are recording without any Mg2+."
