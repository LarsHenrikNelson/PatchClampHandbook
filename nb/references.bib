Little is known of how ASD-­risk genes regulate callosal connectivity. Here, we show that Fmr1, whose loss-­of-­function leads to Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), cell autonomously promotes maturation of callosal excitatory synapses between somatosensory barrel cortices in mice. Postnatal, cell-­autonomous deletion of Fmr1 in postsynaptic Layer (L) 2/3 or L5 neurons results in a selective weakening of AMPA receptor- (R), but not NMDA receptor-, mediated callosal synaptic function, indicative of immature synapses. Sensory deprivation by contralateral whisker trimming normalizes callosal input strength, suggesting that experience-­driven activity of postsynaptic Fmr1 KO L2/3 neurons weakens callosal synapses. In contrast to callosal inputs, synapses originating from local L4 and L2/3 circuits are normal, revealing an input-­specific role for postsynaptic Fmr1 in regulation of synaptic connectivity within local and callosal neocortical circuits. These results suggest direct cell autonomous and postnatal roles for FMRP in development of specific cortical circuits and suggest a synaptic basis for long-­range functional underconnectivity observed in FXS patients.},

Recent work has identified GABAergic interneurons as targets of neuromodulatory input and mediators of state-d ependent gain modulation. Here, we review the engagement and effects of gain modulation in the cortex. We highlight key recent findings that link phenomenological observations of gain modulation to underlying cellular and circuit-level mechanisms.

Independent of this survey, we derived two nonparametric techniques for automating the detection of an action potential threshold from the time-series of intracellular recordings. Both methods start with a phase-space representation of the action potential (dV/dt versus V). Method I detects the maximum slope in the phase space, while Method II detects the maximum second derivative in the phase space. These two methods, as well as five additional methods in the literature, were tested on three data sets representing a variety of action potential shapes, the same three datasets that were used in the electrophysiologist survey. The database of user responses was used to provide an external benchmark against which to statistically evaluate all seven methods. Method II, as well as the curvature-based Methods VI and VII, provided the best results tracking both absolute and relative changes in threshold versus the other nonparametric methods (peak of second and third time derivatives). The one parametric method evaluated, detection of threshold crossing of the first temporal derivative, performed comparably to these methods, provided that an appropriate threshold was chosen. We conclude that Methods II, VI, and VII were the best methods evaluated due to their performance across a wide range of action potential shapes and the fact that they are nonparametric. Our user database of responses may be useful to other investigators interested in developing additional methods in that it quantifies what has often been a subjective estimate.},

Cytoarchitectonically distinct cortical areas have different densities and types of neurons. Thus, signaling patterns may also vary among cytoarchitectonically unique cortical areas. To examine how neuronal signaling patterns are related to innate cortical functions, we detected intrinsic features of cortical firing by devising a metric that efficiently isolates non-Poisson irregular characteristics, independent of spike rate fluctuations that are caused extrinsically by ever-changing behavioral conditions. Using the new metric, we analyzed spike trains from over 1,000 neurons in 15 cortical areas sampled by eight independent neurophysiological laboratories. Analysis of firing-pattern dissimilarities across cortical areas revealed a gradient of firing regularity that corresponded closely to the functional category of the cortical area; neuronal spiking patterns are regular in motor areas, random in the visual areas, and bursty in the prefrontal area. Thus, signaling patterns may play an important role in function-specific cerebral cortical computation.},

            The patch-clamp technique and more recently the high throughput patch-clamp technique have contributed to major advances in the characterization of ion channels. However, the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique presents certain limits that need to be considered for robust data generation. One major caveat is that increasing current amplitude profoundly impacts the accuracy of the biophysical analyses of macroscopic ion currents under study. Using mathematical kinetic models of a cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel and a cardiac voltage-gated potassium channel, we demonstrated how large current amplitude and series resistance artefacts induce an undetected alteration in the actual membrane potential and affect the characterization of voltage-dependent activation and inactivation processes. We also computed how dose–response curves are hindered by high current amplitudes. This is of high interest since stable cell lines frequently demonstrating high current amplitudes are used for safety pharmacology using the high throughput patch-clamp technique. It is therefore critical to set experimental limits for current amplitude recordings to prevent inaccuracy in the characterization of channel properties or drug activity, such limits being different from one channel type to another. Based on the predictions generated by the kinetic models, we draw simple guidelines for good practice of whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings.},

This reduction in efﬁciency of Ca2+ in eliciting release is due to low-afﬁnity Ca2+ binding of both gluconate and ATP2− anions. To study these effects we developed a simple ﬂuorimeteric titration procedure, which reports the dissociation constant, KD, of a given Ca2+ indicator dye, multiplied by 1 plus the sum of Ca2+ binding ratios of any anions, which act as low-afﬁnity Ca2+ ligands. For solutions without Ca2+ binding anions we ﬁnd KD values for Fura2FF ranging from 11.5 ± 1.7 to 15.6 ± 7.47 μM depending on the dominant anion used. For Fura6F and KCl-based solutions we ﬁnd KD = 17.8 ± 1.3 μM. For solutions with gluconate as the main anion and for solutions that contain nucleotides, such as ATP and GTP, we ﬁnd much higher values for the product. Assuming that the KD of the indicator dye is equal to that of KCl-based solutions we calculate the summed Ca2+ binding ratios and ﬁnd a value of 3.55 for a solution containing 100 mM potassium gluconate and 4 mM ATP. Gluconate contributes a value of 1.75 to this number, while the contribution of ATP depends strongly on the presence of Mg2+ and varies from 0.8 (with excess Mg2+) to 13.8 (in the presence of 3 mM free ATP). Methanesulfonate has negligible Ca2+ binding capacity. These results explain the reduced efﬁciency of Ca2+ inﬂux in the presence of gluconate or nucleotides, as these anions are expected to intercept Ca2+ ions at short distance.},

	abstract = {Strontium can replace calcium in triggering neurotransmitter release, although peak release is reduced and the duration of release is prolonged. Strontium has therefore become useful in probing release, but its mechanism of action is not well understood. Here we study the action of strontium at the granule cell to Purkinje cell synapse in mouse cerebellar slices. Presynaptic residual strontium levels were monitored with fluorescent indicators, which all responded to strontium (fura-2, calcium orange, fura-2FF, magnesium green, and mag-fura-5). When calcium was replaced by equimolar concentrations of strontium in the external bath, strontium and calcium both entered presynaptic terminals. Contaminating calcium was eliminated by including EGTA in the extracellular bath, or by loading parallel fibers with EGTA, enabling the actions of strontium to be studied in isolation. After a single stimulus, strontium reached higher peak free levels than did calcium ( 1.7 times greater), and decayed more slowly (half-decay time 189 ms for strontium and 32 ms for calcium). These differences in calcium and strontium dynamics are likely a consequence of greater strontium permeability through calcium channels, lower affinity of the endogenous buffer for strontium, and less efficient extrusion of strontium. Measurements of presynaptic divalent levels help to explain properties of release evoked by strontium. Parallel fiber synaptic currents triggered by strontium are smaller in amplitude and longer in duration than those triggered by calcium. In both calcium and strontium, release consists of two components, one more steeply dependent on divalent levels than the other. Strontium drives both components less effectively than does calcium, suggesting that the affinities of the sensors involved in both phases of release are lower for strontium than for calcium. Thus, the larger and slower strontium transients account for the prominent slow component of release triggered by strontium.},

However, detecting spontaneous PSCs in vitro and in vivo has been challenging, because of the small amplitude, the variable kinetics, and the undeﬁned time of generation of these events. Here, we describe a, to our knowledge, new method for detecting spontaneous synaptic events by deconvolution, using a template that approximates the average time course of spontaneous PSCs. A recorded PSC trace is deconvolved from the template, resulting in a series of delta-like functions. The maxima of these delta-like events are reliably detected, revealing the precise onset times of the spontaneous PSCs. Among all detection methods, the deconvolution-based method has a unique temporal resolution, allowing the detection of individual events in high-frequency bursts. Furthermore, the deconvolution-based method has a high amplitude resolution, because deconvolution can substantially increase the signal/noise ratio. When tested against previously published methods using experimental data, the deconvolution-based method was superior for spontaneous PSCs recorded in vivo. Using the high-resolution deconvolution-based detection algorithm, we show that the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in dentate gyrus granule cells is 4.5 times higher in vivo than in vitro.},

	abstract = {Spike sequences recorded from four cortical areas of an awake behaving monkey were examined to explore characteristics that vary among neurons. We found that a measure of the local variation of interspike intervals, LV, is nearly the same for every spike sequence for any given neuron, while it varies significantly among neurons. The distributions of LV values for neuron ensembles in three of the four areas were found to be distinctly bimodal. Two groups of neurons classified according to the spiking irregularity exhibit different responses to the same stimulus. This suggests that neurons in each area can be classified into different groups possessing unique spiking statistics and corresponding functional properties.},
