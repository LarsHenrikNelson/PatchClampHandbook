Little is known of how ASD-­risk genes regulate callosal connectivity. Here, we show that Fmr1, whose loss-­of-­function leads to Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), cell autonomously promotes maturation of callosal excitatory synapses between somatosensory barrel cortices in mice. Postnatal, cell-­autonomous deletion of Fmr1 in postsynaptic Layer (L) 2/3 or L5 neurons results in a selective weakening of AMPA receptor- (R), but not NMDA receptor-, mediated callosal synaptic function, indicative of immature synapses. Sensory deprivation by contralateral whisker trimming normalizes callosal input strength, suggesting that experience-­driven activity of postsynaptic Fmr1 KO L2/3 neurons weakens callosal synapses. In contrast to callosal inputs, synapses originating from local L4 and L2/3 circuits are normal, revealing an input-­specific role for postsynaptic Fmr1 in regulation of synaptic connectivity within local and callosal neocortical circuits. These results suggest direct cell autonomous and postnatal roles for FMRP in development of specific cortical circuits and suggest a synaptic basis for long-­range functional underconnectivity observed in FXS patients.},

Independent of this survey, we derived two nonparametric techniques for automating the detection of an action potential threshold from the time-series of intracellular recordings. Both methods start with a phase-space representation of the action potential (dV/dt versus V). Method I detects the maximum slope in the phase space, while Method II detects the maximum second derivative in the phase space. These two methods, as well as five additional methods in the literature, were tested on three data sets representing a variety of action potential shapes, the same three datasets that were used in the electrophysiologist survey. The database of user responses was used to provide an external benchmark against which to statistically evaluate all seven methods. Method II, as well as the curvature-based Methods VI and VII, provided the best results tracking both absolute and relative changes in threshold versus the other nonparametric methods (peak of second and third time derivatives). The one parametric method evaluated, detection of threshold crossing of the first temporal derivative, performed comparably to these methods, provided that an appropriate threshold was chosen. We conclude that Methods II, VI, and VII were the best methods evaluated due to their performance across a wide range of action potential shapes and the fact that they are nonparametric. Our user database of responses may be useful to other investigators interested in developing additional methods in that it quantifies what has often been a subjective estimate.},

Cytoarchitectonically distinct cortical areas have different densities and types of neurons. Thus, signaling patterns may also vary among cytoarchitectonically unique cortical areas. To examine how neuronal signaling patterns are related to innate cortical functions, we detected intrinsic features of cortical firing by devising a metric that efficiently isolates non-Poisson irregular characteristics, independent of spike rate fluctuations that are caused extrinsically by ever-changing behavioral conditions. Using the new metric, we analyzed spike trains from over 1,000 neurons in 15 cortical areas sampled by eight independent neurophysiological laboratories. Analysis of firing-pattern dissimilarities across cortical areas revealed a gradient of firing regularity that corresponded closely to the functional category of the cortical area; neuronal spiking patterns are regular in motor areas, random in the visual areas, and bursty in the prefrontal area. Thus, signaling patterns may play an important role in function-specific cerebral cortical computation.},

            The patch-clamp technique and more recently the high throughput patch-clamp technique have contributed to major advances in the characterization of ion channels. However, the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique presents certain limits that need to be considered for robust data generation. One major caveat is that increasing current amplitude profoundly impacts the accuracy of the biophysical analyses of macroscopic ion currents under study. Using mathematical kinetic models of a cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel and a cardiac voltage-gated potassium channel, we demonstrated how large current amplitude and series resistance artefacts induce an undetected alteration in the actual membrane potential and affect the characterization of voltage-dependent activation and inactivation processes. We also computed how dose–response curves are hindered by high current amplitudes. This is of high interest since stable cell lines frequently demonstrating high current amplitudes are used for safety pharmacology using the high throughput patch-clamp technique. It is therefore critical to set experimental limits for current amplitude recordings to prevent inaccuracy in the characterization of channel properties or drug activity, such limits being different from one channel type to another. Based on the predictions generated by the kinetic models, we draw simple guidelines for good practice of whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings.},

	abstract = {Strontium can replace calcium in triggering neurotransmitter release, although peak release is reduced and the duration of release is prolonged. Strontium has therefore become useful in probing release, but its mechanism of action is not well understood. Here we study the action of strontium at the granule cell to Purkinje cell synapse in mouse cerebellar slices. Presynaptic residual strontium levels were monitored with fluorescent indicators, which all responded to strontium (fura-2, calcium orange, fura-2FF, magnesium green, and mag-fura-5). When calcium was replaced by equimolar concentrations of strontium in the external bath, strontium and calcium both entered presynaptic terminals. Contaminating calcium was eliminated by including EGTA in the extracellular bath, or by loading parallel fibers with EGTA, enabling the actions of strontium to be studied in isolation. After a single stimulus, strontium reached higher peak free levels than did calcium ( 1.7 times greater), and decayed more slowly (half-decay time 189 ms for strontium and 32 ms for calcium). These differences in calcium and strontium dynamics are likely a consequence of greater strontium permeability through calcium channels, lower affinity of the endogenous buffer for strontium, and less efficient extrusion of strontium. Measurements of presynaptic divalent levels help to explain properties of release evoked by strontium. Parallel fiber synaptic currents triggered by strontium are smaller in amplitude and longer in duration than those triggered by calcium. In both calcium and strontium, release consists of two components, one more steeply dependent on divalent levels than the other. Strontium drives both components less effectively than does calcium, suggesting that the affinities of the sensors involved in both phases of release are lower for strontium than for calcium. Thus, the larger and slower strontium transients account for the prominent slow component of release triggered by strontium.},

This reduction in efﬁciency of Ca2+ in eliciting release is due to low-afﬁnity Ca2+ binding of both gluconate and ATP2− anions. To study these effects we developed a simple ﬂuorimeteric titration procedure, which reports the dissociation constant, KD, of a given Ca2+ indicator dye, multiplied by 1 plus the sum of Ca2+ binding ratios of any anions, which act as low-afﬁnity Ca2+ ligands. For solutions without Ca2+ binding anions we ﬁnd KD values for Fura2FF ranging from 11.5 ± 1.7 to 15.6 ± 7.47 μM depending on the dominant anion used. For Fura6F and KCl-based solutions we ﬁnd KD = 17.8 ± 1.3 μM. For solutions with gluconate as the main anion and for solutions that contain nucleotides, such as ATP and GTP, we ﬁnd much higher values for the product. Assuming that the KD of the indicator dye is equal to that of KCl-based solutions we calculate the summed Ca2+ binding ratios and ﬁnd a value of 3.55 for a solution containing 100 mM potassium gluconate and 4 mM ATP. Gluconate contributes a value of 1.75 to this number, while the contribution of ATP depends strongly on the presence of Mg2+ and varies from 0.8 (with excess Mg2+) to 13.8 (in the presence of 3 mM free ATP). Methanesulfonate has negligible Ca2+ binding capacity. These results explain the reduced efﬁciency of Ca2+ inﬂux in the presence of gluconate or nucleotides, as these anions are expected to intercept Ca2+ ions at short distance.},

However, detecting spontaneous PSCs in vitro and in vivo has been challenging, because of the small amplitude, the variable kinetics, and the undeﬁned time of generation of these events. Here, we describe a, to our knowledge, new method for detecting spontaneous synaptic events by deconvolution, using a template that approximates the average time course of spontaneous PSCs. A recorded PSC trace is deconvolved from the template, resulting in a series of delta-like functions. The maxima of these delta-like events are reliably detected, revealing the precise onset times of the spontaneous PSCs. Among all detection methods, the deconvolution-based method has a unique temporal resolution, allowing the detection of individual events in high-frequency bursts. Furthermore, the deconvolution-based method has a high amplitude resolution, because deconvolution can substantially increase the signal/noise ratio. When tested against previously published methods using experimental data, the deconvolution-based method was superior for spontaneous PSCs recorded in vivo. Using the high-resolution deconvolution-based detection algorithm, we show that the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in dentate gyrus granule cells is 4.5 times higher in vivo than in vitro.},

	abstract = {Spike sequences recorded from four cortical areas of an awake behaving monkey were examined to explore characteristics that vary among neurons. We found that a measure of the local variation of interspike intervals, LV, is nearly the same for every spike sequence for any given neuron, while it varies significantly among neurons. The distributions of LV values for neuron ensembles in three of the four areas were found to be distinctly bimodal. Two groups of neurons classified according to the spiking irregularity exhibit different responses to the same stimulus. This suggests that neurons in each area can be classified into different groups possessing unique spiking statistics and corresponding functional properties.},

Numerous recent studies have validated the utility of this method for enhancing neuronal preservation and overall brain slice viability. The implementation of this technique by early adopters has facilitated detailed investigations into brain function using diverse experimental applications and spanning a wide range of animal ages, brain regions, and cell types. Steps are outlined for carrying out the protective recovery brain slice technique using an optimized NMDG artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) media formulation and enhanced procedure to reliably obtain healthy brain slices for patch clamp electrophysiology. With this updated approach, a substantial improvement is observed in the speed and reliability of gigaohm seal formation during targeted patch clamp recording experiments while maintaining excellent neuronal preservation, thereby facilitating challenging experimental applications. Representative results are provided from multi-neuron patch clamp recording experiments to assay synaptic connectivity in neocortical brain slices prepared from young adult transgenic mice and mature adult human neurosurgical specimens. Furthermore, the optimized NMDG protective recovery method of brain slicing is compatible with both juvenile and adult animals, thus resolving a limitation of the original methodology. In summary, a single media formulation and brain slicing procedure can be implemented across various species and ages to achieve excellent viability and tissue preservation.},

Ultrastructural evidence for synaptogenic triggers during slice preparation was investigated in 21-day-old rats. Slices chopped under warm or chilled conditions and ﬁxed after 0, 5, 25, 60, or 180 minutes of incubation in an interface chamber were compared with hippocampi ﬁxed by perfusion or by immersion of the whole hippocampus. There was no signiﬁcant synaptogenesis in these slices compared with perfusion-ﬁxed hippocampus, but there were other structural changes during slice preparation and recovery in vitro. Whole hippocampus and slices prepared under warm conditions exhibited an increase in axonal coated vesicles, suggesting widespread neurotransmitter release. Glycogen granules were depleted from astrocytes and neurons in 0-min slices, began to reappear by 1 hour, and had fully recovered by 3 hours. Dendritic microtubules were initially disassembled in slices, but reassembled into normal axial arrays after 5 minutes. Microtubules were short at 5 minutes (12.3 1.1 m) but had recovered normal lengths by 3 hours (84.6 20.0 m) compared with perfusion-ﬁxed hippocampus (91 22 m). Microtubules appeared transiently in 15 3\% and 9 4\% of dendritic spines 5 and 25 minutes after incubation, respectively. Spine microtubules were absent from perfusion-ﬁxed hippocampus and 3-hour slices. Ice-cold dissection and vibratomy in media that blocked activity initially produced less glycogen loss, coated vesicles, and microtubule disassembly. Submersing these slices in normal oxygenated media at 34°C led to glycogen depletion, as well as increased coated vesicles and microtubule disassembly within 1 minute. J. Comp.

Although brain tissue is usually cut at ice-cold temperature (CT) to facilitate slicing and avoid neuronal damage, exposure to CT causes molecular and architectural changes of synapses. To address these issues, we investigated ultrastructural and electrophysiological features of synapses in mouse acute cerebellar slices prepared at ice-cold and physiological temperature (PT). In the slices prepared at CT, we found signiﬁcant spine loss and reconstruction, synaptic vesicle rearrangement and decrease in synaptic proteins, all of which were not detected in slices prepared at PT. Consistent with these structural ﬁndings, slices prepared at PT showed higher release probability. Furthermore, preparation at PT allows electrophysiological recording immediately after slicing resulting in higher detectability of long-term depression (LTD) after motor learning compared with that at CT. These results indicate substantial advantages of the slice preparation at PT for investigating synaptic functions in different physiological conditions.},

	abstract = {More dendritic spine synapses occur on mature neurons in hippocampal slices by 2 h of incubation in vitro, than in perfusion-ﬁxed hippocampus. What conditions initiate this spinogenesis and how rapidly do the spines begin to proliferate on mature neurons? To address these questions, CA1 ﬁeld of the hippocampus neurons expressing green ﬂuorescent protein in living slices from mature mice were imaged with two-photon microscopy. Spines disappeared and dendrites were varicose immediately after slice preparation in ice-cold artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid (ACSF). Electron microscopy (EM) revealed disrupted dendritic cytoplasm, enlarged or free-ﬂoating postsynaptic densities, and excessive axonal endocytosis. Upon warming dendritic varicosities shrank and spines rapidly reappeared within a few minutes illustrating the remarkable resilience of mature hippocampal neurons in slices. When membrane impermeant sucrose was substituted for NaCl in ACSF dendrites remained spiny at ice-cold temperatures and EM revealed less disruption. Nevertheless, spine number and length increased within 30 min in warm ACSF even when the extracellular calcium concentration was zero and synaptic transmission was blocked. When slices were ﬁrst recovered for several hours and then chilled in 6 °C ACSF many spines disappeared and the dendrites became varicose. Upon re-warming varicosities shrank and spines reemerged in the same position from which they disappeared. In addition, new spines formed and spines were longer suggesting that chilling, not the initial injury from slicing, caused the spines to disappear while re-warming triggered the spine proliferation on mature neurons. The new spines might be a substrate for neuronal recovery of function, when neurons have been chilled or exposed to other traumatic conditions that disrupt ionic homeostasis. © 2004 IBRO.

	abstract = {Describing mathematically, the intensity duration curves of electrostimulation by hyperbolas, Lapicque introduced two terms which characterized the functional relationship: “Rheobose” was the lowest intensify with indefinite pulse duration which just stimulated muscles or nerves. “Chronaxie” was that pulse duration at which the threshold intensity was twice that of the rheobase. Up to now, both terms have never played an important role in cardiac pacing.
            However, it can be shown that the chronaxie, especially, is an important parameter—influenced by several factors such as electrode size, material, and stimulation mode—which may help match the generator to its electrode. Practical consequences may be derived from the concept of chronaxie:
            
              
                
                  A pulse duration longer than the chronaxie is not desirable because current consumption is increased without decreasing the threshold significantly.
                
                
                  Pacing with constant current needs twice that pulse duration of constant voltage stimulation.
                
                
                  Smaller electrodes are more favorable because the pulse duration they need may be reduced without losing safety.
                
                
                  Estimation of the safety margin with decreasing output of the generator or with programmable pulse duration is possible if the chronaxie of a specific electrode is known.},

	title = {Inhibitory {GABAergic} neuron loss due to oxidative damage during ex vivo acute brain slice preparation influences genesis and dynamics of epileptiform activity},
	abstract = {Ex vivo acute brain slice is a popular technique in neuroscience research. Since its inception five decades ago, many variations of the brain slice preparation method have emerged. While all variations are currently used by many labs throughout the world, no study has comprehensively examined the impact of these variation on the quality of the acute brain slice preparation. In this study, we comprehensively examined the effect of animal sacrifice methods (decapitation or transcardial perfusion) and cutting solution (normal or sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid) on brain slice preparation. Neuronal population was quantified by immunohistochemistry against various neuronal markers. Neuronal dynamics was evaluated by in vitro electrophysiology using two acute epilepsy models – zero-magnesium and 4-aminopyridine. To modulate the stress incurred in acute brain slice preparation, we administered antioxidants or HIF-1a inhibitor, chrysin, to the cutting solution. The method of brain slice preparation significantly affected the quality of the brain slice preparation. In general, the combination of transcardial perfusion and sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid produces the optimal brain slice preparation. This is evidenced by a preservation of inhibitory GABAergic neurons in slices prepared with this combination. We subsequently found that this loss of inhibitory GABAergic neurons significantly influenced the genesis and dynamics of induced acute epileptiform activity. The slices with preserved inhibition had less successful induction of acute epileptiform activity and a seizure-like event that is typical of those induced in brain with preserved inhibition. Finally, we found that loss of inhibitory GABAergic neurons during brain slice preparation is primarily due to oxidative damage. Limiting oxidative stress is an effective neuroprotection strategy to prevent loss of inhibition in brain slice preparation.

          , 
            GABAergic interneurons are proposed to be critical for early activity and synapse formation by directly exciting, rather than inhibiting, neurons in developing hippocampus and neocortex. However, the role of GABAergic neurons in the generation of neonatal network activity has not been tested in vivo, and recent studies have challenged the excitatory nature of early GABA. By locally manipulating interneuron activity in unanesthetized neonatal mice, we show that GABAergic neurons are excitatory in CA1 hippocampus at postnatal day 3 (P3) and are responsible for most of the spontaneous firing of pyramidal cells at that age. Hippocampal interneurons become inhibitory by P7, whereas visual cortex interneurons are already inhibitory by P3 and remain so throughout development. These regional and age-specific differences are the result of a change in chloride reversal potential, because direct activation of light-gated anion channels in glutamatergic neurons drives CA1 firing at P3, but silences it at P7 in CA1, and at all ages in visual cortex. This study in the intact brain reveals that GABAergic interneuron excitation is essential for network activity in neonatal hippocampus and confirms that visual cortical interneurons are inhibitory throughout early postnatal development.},

	abstract = {Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated (HCN) channels and the current they carry, Ih, are widely and diversely distributed in the central nervous system (CNS). The distribution of the four subunits of HCN channels is variable within the CNS, within brain regions, and often within subcellular compartments. The precise function of Ih can depend heavily on what other channels are co-expressed. In this review, we give an overview of HCN channel structure, distribution, and modulation by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). We then discuss HCN channel and Ih functions, where we have parsed the roles into two main effects: a steady effect on maintaining the resting membrane potential at relatively depolarized values, and slow channel dynamics. Within this framework, we discuss Ih involvement in resonance, synaptic integration, transmitter release, plasticity, and point out a special case, where the effects of Ih on the membrane potential and its slow channel dynamics have dual roles in thalamic neurons.},

	abstract = {Brain slices gain water when maintained in bicarbonate-buffered artiÆcial cerebro-spinal Øuid (ACSF) at 358C. We previously showed that this edema is linked to glutamate receptor activation and oxidative stress. An additional factor that may contribute to swelling is acidosis, which arises from high CO2 tension in brain slices. To examine the role of acidosis in slice edema, we added N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N0-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) to osmotically balanced ACSF (HEPES±ACSF), thereby increasing buffering capacity beyond that provided by bicarbonate/CO2. Water gain was markedly inhibited in HEPES±ACSF. After 3 h incubation in HEPES±ACSF at 358C, water gain was limited to that of fresh slices after 1 h recovery in ACSF at room temperature. The effect of HEPES in decreasing slice water gain was concentration dependent from 0.3 to 20 mM. The inhibition of water gain by HEPES suggests that tissue acidosis is a contributing factor in brain slice edema. q 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},
