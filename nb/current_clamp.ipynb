    "# Current clamp\n",
    "Current clamp recordings are one of the two most common experiment types you will see in papers using path-clamp. Current clamp experiments allow you to get active parameters of cells. Namely gain, rheobase and spike threshold. Current clamp recordings typically use stepped currrent injections or ramps and you are investigating the voltage change due to the current injection and whether the cell spikes."

    "### Internal and external solutions\n",
    "You will need to a standard ACSF for recording. Usually the ACSF bath is mantained at physiological temperature which is considered ~32C however you can record at room temperature. I recommend recording at 32C. You can include drugs in the bath to block synaptic activity but do not need to include these. If you are having a lot of recurrent input that is driving spikes, depolarizations or hyperpolarizations in your cells if may be good to include some drugs to block synpatic currents. The one problem with blocking synaptic currents if that cells change their functionality due to changes in or lack of synaptic input. These are considerations you need to consider. I would recommend starting without any drugs in the bath to keep it simple."

    "One thing to consider is whether you should inject a holding current to bring the cell to a specific resting potential value. Many studies inject some current to hold the cell at around -70mV and run their current pulses or ramps. There are a few studies that do not inject any holding current and even argue against injecting any holding current. Both methods have their merits."

    "As mentioned in the beginning, you can record stepped currents or ramps. Stepped currents are the most common. Usually there are negative and positive steps. The negative steps usually go as low as -150 to -200 pA and positive currents can as high as 600 pA (some interneurons have a very high rheobase). One problem with ramps is that some cells have depolarization block and may not spike during a ramp but will during a set of stepped pulses. Depolarization block is the inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels due to long membrane depolarizations that does not elicit spikes. There are conditions, such as epilepsy, where depolarization block may actually be a feature of the altered cell physiology and you could use the ramp to test whether is still occurs."

The IV curve is used to calculate the membrane resistance. Remember that voltage difference = current * resistance ($\\Delta V=IR$). This can be calculated by finding the baseline voltage of the acquisition and subtracting voltage during the pulse. There are some things consider when calculating the voltage during the current injection. There can be changes in voltage due channels that temporarily open such as due to Ih channels.

    "In the plot above you will notice there is a linear relationship between current and voltage. To get the membrane resistance from these data we just have to run a linear regression between the current and delta V. There are a couple ways that you can run the linear regression. One is you can take all delta Vs, you can take just a subset or you can rectify or take the absolute value of the delta Vs before running the regression. We will do all three since it is easy to do in Python. One really important thing to note is the units of the regressors. current is in pA and delta V is in mV and we need to get to MOhms. To do this we multiply the slope by 1000 to get MOhm. If you run the code below you see that the answers are fairly close. One reason to choose the subset version is that you may change the membrane resistance as the cell gets close to spiking even if it does not spike. However, all three calculations are valid."

    "## Ih voltage sag\n",
    "Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated (HCN) channels are typically responsible for the voltage sag in a current clamp acquisitions. Voltage sag is when the voltage drop is initially larger at the beginning of the current injection than at the end. Many cell types have Ih voltage sag such as dopaminergic cells and layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Measuring voltage sag is fairly straightforward. You just measure the voltage difference between the peak sag and and the voltage in the second half of the current injection similar to measuring delta V. The main way I have seen voltage sag reported is by measuring the sag on the most negative current injection. You could also technically run an IV curve for the voltage sag. To truly determine whether the voltage sag is due to HCN channels you would need to do a flow-in experiment with the drug ZD7288. If you want to run the IV curve I challenge you to modify the IV code above to get the resistance of the channels contributing to the voltage sag."

When resistence increases, the current need to achieve the same delta V decreases. This means that a cell will higher membrane resistance will likely need less synaptic to be able to spike. There are a couple ways you can find rheobase. Find the minimum current needed to get the cell to spike out of all 4 cycles. I do not recommend this since there is variability between cycles and the variability could be affected by a treatment or other factors. Find the minimum current needed to get the cell to spike for each cycle and average the result. This is the method I recommend. The way I find rheobase below depends on the acquisitions being assigned to a cycle (1 to inf) which ClampSuite automatically. This may not be the case for your data.

There are many other factors that you could pass, such as bounding factors but are not needed in this case. Lastly you can fit the entire array of current values, however neurons will only spike when there is a net positive current injection. We can truncate our arrays of current and hertz so that only the pairs that have a current >= 0 are kept. You can fit the sigmoid curve to whole set of data and it will likely fit well."

    "## Spike threshold\n",
    "Spike threshold is tells you at what voltage a cells spike is elicited. This different from rheobase. Spike threhold is primarly set by the number of sodium channels on the axon hillock. You can measure spike threshold on any acquisition that has a spike, however usually just the spikes from the rheobase acquisitions are used to calculate the spike threshold. There are several ways to calculate the spike threshold such a the first derivative, second derivative, third derivative, and a max curvature {cite}`sekerli_estimating_2004`. I find the third derivative and method VII to be the most consistent. We will use the third derivative method in this tutorial. The way I typically differentiate signals is by using [numpy.gradient](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.gradient.html). Unlike [numpy.diff](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.diff.html), [numpy.gradient](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.gradient.html) returns an array of the same length as the input signal which makes downstream analysis easier. It has the downside in that if you have small peaks you will get some artifacts in the signal which upsampling can counteract. One problem I found with the third derivative is that the peaks found a usually to late by 1 sample at 10000 Hz so I adjust the spike threshold backwards by 1 sample. I also z-score the derivative since this keeps the peak finding threshold consistent between acquisitions."

    "The next waveform feature that we can measure is the spike (half) width. Half width is important because it can help you determine if there is broadening or shortening of the waveform. Broadening of the waveform can be due to inactivation of the voltage-gated potassium channels, slower-inactivating sodium channels or even decreased activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. Wavefrom broadening increases synaptic output by increasing release probability by increasing the time calcium is in the presynapse {cite}`zbili_past_2019`. This is where the voltage crosses half way between the spike threshold and peak. One important caveat of measuring spike width as the half-way point is that if your spike threshold or peak is changed then your half-width will likely be different."

    "## Spike afterhyperpolarization (AHP)\n",
    "The spike afterhyperpolarization (AHP) is the refactory period, the period where a neuron cannot fire another action potential. The AHP is defined as when the membrane voltage drops below the resting membrane potential of a neuron. However, when injecting current. you will rarely see the AHP drop below the resting membrane potential or the potential where the cell is being held. The are a a couple ways that you could analyze the AHP. One way is setting a time cutoff after the spike for what part of the AHP you want to analyze and integrate over that period. One thing to consider with this method is that you will likely want to integrate over a percent of the AHP rather than using a strict time cutoff since the AHP will get shorter at higher spike frequencies. This is typically how people calculate the slow and fast components of the AHP. You can also find the peak or most negative component of the AHP and when it occurs."

    "## Spike derivative\n",
    "The spike derivative is useful because we can look at the currents underlying the spike itself. While we cannot see the exact Na+, K+ and Ca+ currents we can get an idea of what currents might be altered. To convert a voltage spike to current spike we must multiply the spike derivative by the capacitance of the cell since the current (I) = -C*dV/dt. The current action potential is very similar to the current action potentials that you get when you record spontaneous action potentials is cell-attached voltage-clamp mode. This equation works because a cell is a capacitor due to the lipid membrane. The first peak, or most negative peak primarily consists of Na+ currents where as the second peak likely consists of K+ and Ca+ currents {cite}`bean_action_2007`. One interesting thing to note is the peak current in these spikes (~-2000 pA) is typically around the current you get with unclamped spikes when running a electrical/optical stimulation experiment."
