    "The first concept we are going to cover is delta V and analyzing the IV (current-voltage curve). Delta V is simply the change in voltage due to the current injection. The IV curve is used to calculate the membrane resistance. Remember that voltage difference = current * resistance ($\\Delta V=IR$). This can be calculated by finding the baseline voltage of the acquisition and subtracting voltage during the pulse. There are some things consider when calculating the voltage during the current injection. There can be changes in voltage due channels that temporarily open such as due to Ih channels. To avoid the contribution of these channels I recommend get the mean voltage of the current injection in the last 50%, or even 30%, of the current injection."

    "In the plot above you will notice there is a linear relationship between current and voltage. To get the membrane resistance from these data we just have to run a linear regression between the current and delta V. There are a couple ways that you can run the linear regression. One is you can take all delta Vs, you can take just a subset or you can rectify or take the absolute value of the delta Vs before running the regression. We will do all three since it is easy to do in Python. One really important thing to note is the units of the regressors. current is in pA and delta V is in mV and we need to get to MOhms. To do this we multiply the slope by 1000 to get MOhm. If you run the code below you see that the answers are fairly close. One reason to choose the subset version is that you may change the membrane resistance as the cell gets close to spiking even if it does not spike. However, all three calculations are valid."

    "## Ih voltage sag\n",
    "Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotideâ€“gated (HCN) channels are typically responsible for the voltage sag in a current clamp acquisitions. Voltage sag is when the voltage drop is initially larger at the beginning of the current injection than at the end. Many cell types have Ih voltage sag such as dopaminergic cells and layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Measuring voltage sag is fairly straightforward. You just measure the voltage difference between the peak sag and and the voltage in the second half of the current injection similar to measuring delta V. The main way I have seen voltage sag reported is by measuring the sag on the most negative current injection. You could also technically run an IV curve for the voltage sag. To truly determine whether the voltage sag is due to HCN channels you would need to do a flow-in experiment with the drug ZD7288. If you want to run the IV curve I challenge you to modify the IV code above to get the resistance of the channels contributing to the voltage sag."

    "Rheobase is the minimum current required to get a cell to spike. This measure is directly related to membrane resistance through the equation: V=IR. When resistence increases, the current need to achieve the same delta V decreases. This means that a cell will higher membrane resistance will likely need less synaptic to be able to spike. There are a couple ways you can find rheobase. Find the minimum current needed to get the cell to spike out of all 4 cycles. I do not recommend this since there is variability between cycles and the variability could be affected by a treatment or other factors. Find the minimum current needed to get the cell to spike for each cycle and average the result. This is the method I recommend. The way I find rheobase below depends on the acquisitions being assigned to a cycle (1 to inf) which ClampSuite automatically. This may not be the case for your data.

    "## Spike threshold\n",
    "Spike threshold is tells you at what voltage a cells spike is elicited. This different from rheobase. Spike threhold is primarly set by the number of sodium channels on the axon hillock. You can measure spike threshold on any acquisition that has a spike, however usually just the spikes from the rheobase acquisitions are used to calculate the spike threshold. There are several ways to calculate the spike threshold such a the first derivative, second derivative, third derivative, and a max curvature cite`{sekerli_estimating_2004}`. I find the third derivative to be the most consistent and it is the method that is used in this tutorial. We also will upsample the spike acquisition because every time we differentiate the signal we essentially smooth the signal and can loose important features. The way I typically differentiate signals is by using a special algorithm call gradient from the Numpy library. Unlike diff, gradient returns an array of the same length as the input signal which makes downstream analysis easier. It has the downside in that if you have small peaks you will get some artifacts in the signal which upsampling can conteract. One problem I found with the third derivative is that the peaks found a usually to late by 1 sample at 10000 Hz so I adjust the spike threshold backwards by 1 sample (or 4 in since we are going to upsample by a factor of 4). I also z-score the derivative since this keeps the peak finding threshold consistent between acquisitions."

    "First lets look a single acquisition to see how the method works. One thing we are going to do just for visualization purposes is limit the extent of the x-axis so that we are just looking at the first spike. If you look at the third derivative we want to extract the first positive peak. There are some additions that I have found are helpful."
