# Preparing for recording
Preparing brain tissue for recording is a crucial step. If your tissue is bad, your recordings will be bad. You will find that every lab uses a slightly different protocol. While you could argue that variability in the protocols could make is harder to replicate studies across labs, the most important thing is that you can get stable cells. Variability between protocols is within in reason because there is only so much you can change before you do not get viable tissue. There are papers that claim to have improved protocols but they generally have very little good data to back them up. We cover many differences between protocols and the support or lack of support for these protocols.

## Steps to process tissue for recording
Generally there are about 3 steps you can take before recording: perfusion, tissue slicing and tissue recovery. The only step that is optional is perfusion, the last two you generally have to do. Most of the variability comes from what solutions you use and how you let the tissue recover.

## Perfusion
Perfusion is not considered an essential step but many labs perfuse anyways for a variety of reasons that I have not found support for. A general definition of perfusion is removal of the blood in the animal but replacing the blood with an osmotically similar fluid. You could use PBS and any version of ACSF. For patch clamp electrophysiology researchers use some version of ACSF. When blood gets into the brain tissue in a living organism is can be quit catostrophic such as during a stroke or TBI. Perfusion does remove blood however, when slicing the tissue any blood is released into the cutting solution and does not necessarily embedded into the tissue. Additionally, there is relatively little blood in the brain. I have noticed in adult animal the blood cells can occasionally form strings that come off the cut blood vessels and get in the way of patching a cells. Generally the blood stays contained within the blood vessels. 

### Perfusing the subject
To perfuse, you need sedate the mouse with avertin or isoflurane. You want to avoid anesthetics with long half-life since these could bind to receptors that you are trying to record from. Avertin and isoflurane are fast acting and quick to wear off. Next you need to open the chest cavity and cut the right aorta to allow for the blood to exit the circulatory system. Using a syringe or perstaltic pump you will puncture the right ventrical and inject your fluid of choice. You should see the liver slowly turn form a dark red to a light brown/pink color. For young mice you need to inject about 8-10 mL were as an adult mouse can take up to 25 mL (rats take significantly more) depending on much you want to clear the brain of blood. In adult mice you can inject ~10 mL/min, the younger the mouse the slower you want to go. 

### Chilled vs room temperature perfusion solution
For patch clamp electrophysiology you can use a chilled or room temperature solution. The reasoning behind using a chilled solution is that is slows brain metabolism and thus slows degradation of the brain. I have not seen any evidence to support this, but it is a relatively minor consideration since it is easy to chill a solution. One point that several researchers brought up is that if you are going to chill the perfusion solution you should probabably try to keep the brain chilled throughout the extraction and cutting steps. Another thing to point out is that since some rodent brain are relatively small they warm up quickly after extracting the brain thus chilling might provide minimal benefit. Additionally, if the perfusion solution is running through a pump it might warm up by the time it gets to the subject depending on how cold the solution is. The solution will also take time to cool subjects body to a point where the body is not warming up the solution.

### Choice of perfusion solution
For patch clamp electrophysiology you will want to use some version of ACSF rather PBS. The osmolality of PBS is considerably lower than ACSF. I have seen papers perfuse with standard ACSF or ACSF that has the Na+ substituded with sucrose, choline or NMDG. The reason to use a low Na+ ACSF is that it is thought to prevent excitotoxicity. I have not seen any good evidence that the type of ACSF matters for perfusion but this is hard to test. Some labs use ACSF for perfusion but a Na+ substituted ACSF for cutting so you don't necessarily need to use the same solution for perfusion and cutting. One thing to note is that choline is a mild cholinergic agonist so if you want to avoid that do not use choline ACSF.

## Cutting
The same solutions that are used for perfusion can be used for cutting tissue.
