    "## The t-test\n",
    "The t-test is perhaps one of the simplest statistical tests you can run. Usually in electrophysiology we are comparing two different (independent) groups, comparing two different timepoints or drug treatment within a group (paired, not independent) or comparing whether a single group is different from a predefined mean (one-sample t-test) which can be used for a paired t-test. You can run a t-test using Scipy or Statsmodels in Python. I always recommend getting the confidence intervals of the difference between the two groups. Usually when the confidence intervals of the difference do not include 0 a statistically significant effect. The Further from 0 that your interval is the larger the effect size. Since the p-value is dependent on sample size this helps interpret the p-value. If you are running a t-test between two different groups there are several things to consider.\n",
    "1. Are your data normally distributed? Yes, go to 2.\n",
    "2. Are your two groups independent? Yes, use z-test, t-test or Welch's t-test. No, use paired t-test.\n",
    "3. Is the variance of your two groups the same? Yes, use standard t-test. No, use Welch's t-test.\n",
    "4. Are you sample sizes unequal? Use Welch's t-test\n",
    "5. How large are your sample sizes? Larger than ~30 use the z-test\n",

    "## Rank-based two-sample statistics\n",
    "There are a variety of non-parametric two-sample rank-based statistics such as Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Rank based tests can be used with continuous or ordinal data. Some things you should be aware of before using rank-based tests. If your data is continuous, try transforming your data before running a rank-based test. I often see people fall back to Mann-Whitney for non-normal data. However, in most cases a simple log-transform would have been enough to make the data fit the assumptions of the t-test and its variants. Another is that for rank-based tests in biological sciences we generally want to test if the location or scale is different but not both because that makes interpreting our data hard. To do so we are most interested in the median. If your two samples each have a distribution (same gamma) with different shapes **AND** dispersion you may not have a difference in medians (due to location or scale) which is what we really want to test with rank-based tests. The test is still valid you just cannot say where the difference in your samples are. If you do not know the terms location, shape, scale or dispersion check out the [Distributions](=distributions) chapter. Non-parametric rank-based statistics really have almost as many assumptions as parametric-based statistics. Rank-based statistics can also be sensitive the number of ties or the number of same values between your two group. Rank-based statistics are also not a substitute for parametric tests when your sample size is small (n=3 for each group). The last case where rank-based tests may be useful is when you have outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mann-Whitney U\n",
    "[Mann-Whitney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test#cite_note-H1976-21) is a rank-based statistical test for two indepedent samples. Rather than compare the mean difference, Mann-Whitney essentially scores how many values are larger than in the other group and creates a U score for each group which is used to generate a p-value. One thing to note that the U value that Scipy outputs changes depending on what group is one and what group is two but, the p value will be the same since the p value is calculated from the smaller U value. The second U value can be calculated $U2 = n1*n2-U1$. Another thing to note is that you have to use a different method to calculate the p value if your sample size is small. The Mann-Whitney tests has a table of precomputed critical values for smaller sample sizes. For the Mann-Whitney test to be valid your data must come from the same distribution type otherwise interpreting your what difference your significant p-value is showing is next to impossible. When reporting the Mann-Whitney p-values you should also report the difference between the medians (or the median of each group), the [Hodges-Lehmann estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodges%E2%80%93Lehmann_estimator) which is like an effects size measures for the Mann-Whitney test and the [probability of superiority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_of_superiority) which gives you the probability that values in one group will be large than another when randomly choosing two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other parameters in the Scipy version are `alternative`. This is if you are expecting group one to be more or less than group two. The method parameter `method` is used to define whether to use the exact, asymptotic or permutation p value calculation. \"Auto\" is probably the best for most things but Scipy recommends passing a `Permutation` instance if there are less than 10 samples in one of the groups and there are ties."
