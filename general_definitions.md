# General definitions
## Amplifier
A simple amplifier increases the magnitude of a signal. Electrophysiological signals are fairly small, mV and pA. Additionally, the amplifier provides power to the headstage which uses active electronics like op-amps. Amplifiers can also provide filtering, ability to switch between different modes like current clamp, voltage clamp and I=0, Rs/Ra compensation, capacitance offset, etc.
## Headstage
The headstage conditions the signal the before it goes to the amplifier. Some modern headstages even digitize the signal so that it can go straight to the ADC/DAC
## ADC/DAC
The analog to digital converter (ADC) converts the analog signals from the amplifier to a digital signal. The digital to analog converter (DAC) converts the digital "signals" from your computer to analog signals. The ADC/DAC are usually in the same box.
